            <p class="subheading">The history of green tea in China goes back to 8th century and the method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves, became popular in 12th century. That is when matcha was discovered by a Buddhist monk, Myoan Eisai, and brought to Japan. Esai realized that drinking matcha improved his Zen meditation sessions by producing a state of calm alertness. (Today we know this is thanks to the interaction of matcha’s caffeine and L-theanine). As the benefits of matcha become more widely recognized it became the basis for the sophisticated art of Japanese Tea Ceremony or “chado.”</p>

       <h1>MAKE A MATCHA FOR YOURSELF</h1>
              <h2> The Traditional Method</h2>
                     <p>1. Sift the matcha into a mug or small bowl to get rid of any lumps. Matcha clumps very easily, so it is recommended sifting it before you add any water.</p>

                     <p>2. Pour in the 2 ounces of the hot water. Using a matcha whisk or small regular whisk, whisk briskly from side to side until the matcha is fully dispersed and there is a foamy layer on top.</p>
                     
                     <p> 3. Finally, top it off with more hot water or steamed milk. Traditional matcha tea is made with just matcha powder and water, but you can also easily make a latte by finishing your drink with steamed milk.</p>
