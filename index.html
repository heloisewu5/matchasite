            <p class="subheading">Matcha is a type of powdered green tea that's rich in antioxidants. With traditional green tea, the leaves are steeped in hot water and then discarded. But with matcha, the dried leaves are actually ground into a powder, mixed into the drink, and consumed. The tea has a unique, non-bitter taste and vibrant green color and is regarded as the most aromatic form of green tea.</p>

                            <p>Matcha is a type of green tea. Manufacturers use specialized growing and processing techniques to turn the Camellia sinensis leaves into matcha. Matcha has a vibrant green color. Depending on the preparation, it may be slightly foamy at the top. Matcha has a grassy, earthy flavor, with sweet and bitter undertones. Matcha goes through a more careful growth and extraction process than other teas.</p>
